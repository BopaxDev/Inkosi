# PostgreSQL

# Introduction

To the state of art, the PostgreSQL instance is necessary to save all the information relatively to the organisation chart, as could be seen from <span style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:center; vertical-align: middle; padding:3px;">models.py</span> in the inkosi.database.postgresql package.

The organisation chart essentaily represents all the different figures composing a Financial Institution, those already mentioned at the [Dashboard](../../../index.md)

Here, you will find all the information regarding schemas and models, and part of the database modules. The rest is directly available on the code, there are methods of the PostgreSQLCrud, that are used to answer all the different endpoints available.
